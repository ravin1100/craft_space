Workflow:

1. Brainstorm with GPT - reasoning model and create a detailed PRD
2. upload the PRD on claude & gemini and ask it to find scope of hallucinations for a coding agent
3. once point 2 is done let's draft more detailed informations for cursorAl
   - draft details of backend
     - framework to be used
     - databases to be used
     - authentication & authorization mechanism

     - don't take decisions on your own
     - discuss before assuming
     - if multiple approach tell me why you are using one over other
   - execution plan
     - using MoSCoW framework make a plan for smallest of the tasks that the agent has to update
     - define into multiple phase where each phase has smallest of tasks mentioend
     - Choose right model for the task and then get started

- build phase -> test manually -> test through code -> move to next phase
- after every phase ask it to update todos & update a document using html + CSS + mermaid for documentation
